# Summary

**SpaceBio** is an open-source platform and data warehouse that aggregates, transforms, and organizes scientific literature and related data focused on human space exploration. With access to over 370,000 peer-reviewed publications across disciplines such as spaceflight, microgravity research, astrobiology, and exoplanet science, SpaceBio enables efficient discovery and in-depth analysis of research conducted beyond Earth.

Beyond serving as a literature database, SpaceBio integrates data from multiple sources—both scientific and operational—encompassing rocket launch records, space exploration news, and other contextual information relevant to researchers and educators. The platform supports natural language queries and intelligent search strategies, empowering scientists, educators, and space enthusiasts to interact with space knowledge in meaningful ways.

Additionally, SpaceBio offers a virtual telescope interface designed to enhance space education. This tool enables educators around the world to simulate observations and engage students in interactive learning experiences about the cosmos.

SpaceBio is part of the broader Lupe Project, an initiative dedicated to democratizing access to space science knowledge through the use of artificial intelligence and modern data infrastructure.

# Statement of Need

Human space exploration is a multidisciplinary frontier involving life sciences, physics, engineering, and planetary science. However, locating relevant and high-quality literature across these fields remains a challenge due to the fragmented and vast nature of available research.

SpaceBio addresses this by providing a unified, searchable database optimized for space exploration studies, with a focus on biology and human health in space. It offers researchers a streamlined way to identify prior work, explore trends, and support hypothesis generation for future missions and experiments in microgravity or extraterrestrial environments.

# Functionality

SpaceBio is developed in Python and integrates various open-source technologies to process, classify, and retrieve scientific documents from public datasets. Core functionalities include:

- A user-friendly web interface for querying literature in natural language
- Tag-based and keyword-based filtering (e.g., “plants on ISS”, “microgravity effects on muscles”)
- AI-based enrichment and categorization of topics
- Exporting results for meta-analysis or citation tracking
- Support for continuous integration with new publications

SpaceBio's backend is designed for scalability and modularity, allowing easy extension with new data sources, machine learning models, or domain-specific ontologies.
