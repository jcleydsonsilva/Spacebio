# Summary

Human space exploration is among the most ambitious scientific endeavors, pushing the limits of biology, engineering, and psychology. Missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond demand integrated, innovative solutions to ensure human survival in extreme, isolated environments. Recent research underscores this complexity, examining everything from human behavior on long missions (Pagnini et al., 2023) to the effects of microgravity on cells, the nervous system, and immunity (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Laranjeiro et al., 2021). Building sustainable Martian habitats, for example, requires harmonizing architecture, health, and technology (Sun et al., 2024). Essential technologies now include advanced plumbing for microgravity (Weislogel et al., 2022), biomanufacturing (Lee et al., 2025), biomining (Cockell et al., 2020), and bioregenerative life support using plants and microbes (De Micco et al., 2023).

Meanwhile, programs like Artemis and missions from China and India highlight the geopolitical and scientific significance of a human presence in space (Creech et al., 2022; Gu, 2022; Padma, 2023). Facilities such as EDEN ISS and the Chinese Space Station are already generating critical data for future Mars colonies. Within this landscape, the SpaceBio platform emerges as a dedicated database for literature on space biology and deep space exploration. Its goal is to streamline access to research, organize multidisciplinary knowledge, and foster collaboration in life support, health, biotechnology, space farming, and habitat design. By curating hundreds of scientific references across key themes, SpaceBio is becoming a vital resource for researchers, engineers, educators, and policymakers. As space science grows more strategic for humanity’s future, platforms like SpaceBio are crucial for advancing safe, sustainable exploration.

# Statement of Need

Human space exploration stands at the intersection of life sciences, physics, engineering, planetary science, and computational methods, making it one of the most multidisciplinary frontiers in modern research [chatzitheodoridis2025perspectives]. Despite this convergence, researchers face persistent challenges in accessing relevant, high-quality literature due to the fragmented and rapidly expanding body of work across these diverse domains. SpaceBio directly addresses this gap by providing a unified, intelligent data warehouse tailored for human space exploration studies, with a focus on biological and human health research in space environments. The platform empowers scientists to efficiently discover prior work, analyze knowledge trends, and generate hypotheses to guide future missions and experiments in microgravity and extraterrestrial settings.

To fulfill its mission, SpaceBio is built on a modular, scalable, and production-ready architecture. The backend employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern using Python’s Django framework and a PostgreSQL relational database, ensuring robust code organization, efficient data processing, and straightforward extensibility.On the frontend, SpaceBio utilizes Tailwind CSS alongside Django templates, embracing a utility-first, component-based design that accelerates development, ensures interface consistency, and minimizes the need for custom styling. This approach enhances maintainability and delivers a cohesive user experience.

The data warehouse is populated through an automated pipeline featuring a custom web crawler and data retrieval modules. These interact with major scientific literature APIs—including Europe PMC, PubMed, Scopus, Crossref, and Semantic Scholar—using carefully curated keyword queries and adhering to API rate limits to guarantee both relevance and compliance. Beyond aggregating scientific publications, SpaceBio integrates supplementary data such as rocket launch events, space exploration news, and a virtual telescope interface for global educational engagement. This positions SpaceBio not only as a vital research tool, but also as a dynamic platform for teaching and public outreach, supporting both the scientific community and broader audiences interested in the future of human space exploration

# Functionality

SpaceBio is a modular, scalable Python platform that integrates open-source technologies to retrieve, process, classify, and serve scientific and space-related data. Its architecture supports easy extension with new data sources, machine learning models, and domain-specific ontologies.

Key features:

  * Automated Literature Retrieval: A custom web crawler and ingestion modules connect to databases like Europe PMC, PubMed, Scopus, Crossref, and Semantic Scholar. Curated keyword strategies maximize precision and relevance, while API rate limits and data policies are respected.

  * Real-Time Space Event Tracking: Integration with APIs such as Spaceflight News and The Space Devs provides structured data on missions, rockets, launch sites, agencies, and status updates, contextualizing literature with up-to-date exploration data.

  * Intelligent Search Interface: A user-friendly web interface enables natural language, tag-based, and keyword-based queries (e.g., "plants on the ISS," "microgravity effects on the cardiovascular system"), streamlining interdisciplinary research access.

  * Semantic Enrichment and Topic Categorization: AI-driven classification organizes content into thematic domains, improving discovery of relevant publications and research trends.

  * Educational Integration and Outreach: Built-in virtual telescope and educational modules make SpaceBio accessible for interactive learning by teachers and students worldwide.

  * Export and Interoperability: Search results are exportable for meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and citation tracking, supporting reproducible research.

  * Continuous Updates: Regular synchronization with all connected sources ensures users access the latest scientific findings.
